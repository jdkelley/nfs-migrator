# [WIP] - `nfs-migrator`

This tool migrates an nfs share directory from one nfs server to another. Was developed for migrating stateful data used by containers from one container orchestration provider to another.

At the moment, this script assumes that the nfs share directory is at `/nfs` on the nfs server.
